# Hypothyroidism-Classification


## Contributors

## Description
This is a brief analysis that was done on patient's data collected by Nairobi Hospital during a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. 


Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) is a condition in which your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of certain crucial hormones.

Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Over time, untreated hypothyroidism can cause a number of health problems, such as obesity, joint pain, infertility and heart disease.

Accurate thyroid function tests are available to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with synthetic thyroid hormone is usually simple, safe and effective once you and your doctor find the right dose for you.Hypothyroidism signs and symptoms may include:Fatigue, Increased sensitivity to cold, Constipation, Dry skin, Weight gain, Puffy face, Hoarseness, 
Muscle weakness etc.

The main aim of this project was to build a classification model which can determine whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid

## Findings/Results
The best model on the decision trees built was the Gradient boosting classifier. However, the RBF kernel SVC model outperforms it and is considered to be the best model to use for the classification.


## Complete Setup / Installation Requirements
